## Project Description

This node.js program uses the Express.js, mutiple webpacks and service workers to create a persistant web application that can also be downloaded as an app on the user's machine for use while offline

## Usage Instructions

### Locally hosting

To ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed, make sure that the package.json files have been properly copied over. Once this is done, open your terminal in the project's main directory and enter the command 'npm i' to install all the required dependencies.

After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the backend and serve the client by entering the command 'npm run start' in the terminal. This will initiate the bundling process of the html, css, and javascript files using webpack, along with a service worker and manifest file.

By following these steps, you can successfully start the project and launch it in your preferred browser.

### Using the site

To use this straightforward text editor, simply navigate to the live webpage. You can write to your heart's content, knowing that your words will be saved and secured with the help of local storage, indexdb, and a service worker.

Moreover, if you wish to access your work offline, you can click on the 'install' button located at the top of the page. Doing so will install JATE as an app-icon on your machine, enabling you to access your work anytime, anywhere, without any internet connection.

### Functionality includes:

This web application has the capability to support next-gen JavaScript, allowing you to use the latest features available. In addition, it provides persistent data storage through Local Storage and IndexDB, ensuring that your data is always saved and retrievable.

If you wish to have easy access to this web app at all times, you can download it to your desktop. Once downloaded, you can use it anytime, even when offline, without the need for an internet connection.
